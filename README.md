# Cloud EMail provider

This is a small website build to discover the cloud email service used by a specific domain. This is determined by doing a DNS lookup of the domains MX records. In a database the domains used by the different cloud emali providers are stored and compared.

This system requires PHP and a webserver to run. This can be deployed in a Azure Web App Service environment.
